DESCRPITON
    This module is a CPANPLUS backend that recursively generates Gentoo
    ebuilds for a given package in the specified overlay (defaults to
    /usr/local/portage), updates the manifest, and even emerges it (together
    with its dependencies) if the user requires it. You need write
    permissions on the directory where Gentoo fetches its source files
    (usually /usr/portage/distfiles). The valid "KEYWORDS" for the generated
    ebuilds are by default those given in "ACCEPT_KEYWORDS", but you can
    specify your own with the "keywords" dist-option.

    The generated ebuilds are placed into the "perl-gcpanp" category. They
    favour depending on a "virtual", on "perl-core", "dev-perl" or
    "perl-gcpan" (in that order) rather than "perl-gcpanp".

INSTALLATION
    After installing this module, you should append "perl-gcpanp" to your
    /etc/portage/categories file.

METHODS
    This module inherits all the methods from CPANPLUS::Dist::Base. Please
    refer to its documentation for precise information on what's done at
    each step.

  "intuit_license"
    Returns an array reference to a list of Gentoo licences identifiers
    under which the current distribution is released.

  "update_manifest"
    Updates the Manifest file for the ebuild associated to the current dist
    object.

  "ebuild_source"
    Returns the source of the ebuild for the current dist object, or "undef"
    when one of the dependencies couldn't be mapped to an existing ebuild.

DEPENDENCIES
